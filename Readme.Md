Django Project Setup Guide
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, please ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

Python 3.x (Download from python.org)
pip (Python package manager, usually installed with Python)
Virtualenv (for creating a virtual environment)
You can check if these are installed by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
python --version
pip --version
virtualenv --version
If any of these commands return an error, please install the software before proceeding.

Step 1: Clone the Project
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine. You can either use Git to clone the project or download it as a ZIP file.

Option 1: Clone with Git
If you have Git installed, open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
Option 2: Download as ZIP
If you don’t have Git, you can simply download the project as a ZIP file. Extract the contents and open the extracted folder in your terminal or command prompt.

Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other Python projects, it’s recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project. This will ensure that the project dependencies are isolated.

Open the terminal or command prompt in the project folder.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
virtualenv venv
This will create a venv folder in the project directory, which contains the virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Once activated, you should see (venv) in your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Now that the virtual environment is set up, you can install the required dependencies for the project.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary libraries and dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Step 4: Run Database Migrations
To set up the database and apply all necessary migrations, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
This command will create the necessary database tables and set up the structure.


Step 5: Collect Static Files
If your project includes static files (CSS, JavaScript, images), you need to collect them into a single location for easier access. Run:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py collectstatic
When prompted, confirm by typing yes.

Step 6: Start the Development Server
Now that everything is set up, you can start the Django development server and view the application in your browser.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.
